      <h1>Agent Assignment Brief</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to your first operational assignment with the Lugus Centre for
        Technology Safety. This document outlines your mission objectives, cover
        identity, and the specific tasks you are expected to carry out during
        this high-stakes operation.
      </p>

      <h2>Mission Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Your mission is to infiltrate Raktus Island under the guise of working
        for a proxy company, Genovia Supply Co., which provides essential office
        supplies and stationery to government facilities on the island. This
        cover will grant you special access to various locations, including the
        highly restricted areas where Project Horus is being developed.
      </p>

      <h2>Cover Identity</h2>
      <p>
        Your cover identity is as an employee of Genovia Supply Co.,
        specifically as a logistics coordinator responsible for overseeing the
        delivery and management of office supplies. This role will allow you to
        move freely within the government buildings and research facilities on
        Raktus Island without raising suspicion.
      </p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            1. Identify Key Personnel: Use your access to identify and monitor
            the key individuals involved in Project Horus. Pay particular
            attention to those with direct access to the AI’s core development.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            2. Gather Intelligence: Leverage your role to gather as much
            information as possible about the AI's capabilities, training
            methods, and intended applications. Your observations should focus
            on the AI’s interactions with human operators and any signs of
            autonomous decision-making.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            3. Document Unusual Activity: Report any abnormal behavior or
            developments related to the AI that could indicate a risk of it
            surpassing its intended control parameters. This includes observing
            any interactions between the AI and government officials.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            4. Secure Access Points: Identify any security weaknesses in the
            facility’s infrastructure that could be exploited in the event of an
            emergency extraction or further infiltration. This includes
            monitoring communication channels and entry/exit points.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Operational Details</h2>
      <p>
        Deployment Date: You will be deployed to Raktus Island in three days.
        Your first task will be to familiarize yourself with the island’s layout
        and the locations where Genovia Supply Co. operates. Ensure that you
        maintain your cover at all times, especially when interacting with
        government personnel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Duration: The initial phase of the operation is expected to last six
        months, during which you will provide regular updates through secure
        communication channels. Any immediate threats or discoveries that
        require urgent attention should be reported immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>Security Protocols</h2>
      <p>
        Your safety and the integrity of this operation are of the utmost
        importance. As such, adhere strictly to the following security
        protocols:
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            1. Maintain Cover: Always present yourself as a dedicated logistics
            coordinator. Do not deviate from your cover identity under any
            circumstances.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            2. Secure Communication: Use only the secure channels provided by
            the Lugus Centre for transmitting sensitive information. Never
            discuss mission details over unsecured lines.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            3. Emergency Procedures: In the event of a compromised cover or
            imminent danger, you will be provided with an emergency extraction
            plan. Familiarize yourself with the protocol upon arrival.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This operation is critical to preventing the potential misuse of Project
        Horus, which poses a significant threat to global security. Your role is
        vital to gathering the intelligence needed to assess and neutralize this
        threat. Stay focused, vigilant, and above all, maintain your cover at
        all times.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are counting on your success. Good luck, Agent
