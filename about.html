      <h1>The Lugus Institute</h1>

      <p class="mission">
        The Lugus Institute is a globally recognized think tank dedicated to
        safeguarding humanity from the potential risks posed by emerging
        technologies, particularly artificial intelligence. Our mission is to
        ensure that technological advancements contribute positively to society
        and do not compromise human autonomy, safety, or ethics.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Lugus Institute is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, a hub for
        international cooperation and home to numerous global organizations. Our
        location enables us to engage with a wide network of partners and
        experts from around the world, ensuring that our work is informed by
        diverse perspectives and cutting-edge research.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to our Geneva headquarters, we have satellite offices in key
        locations such as Silicon Valley, London, and Tokyo, allowing us to
        maintain close ties with technology leaders and innovators across the
        globe.
      </p>

      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2010 by a group of visionary technologists and ethicists, the
        Lugus Institute was established in response to the rapid acceleration of
        AI research and development. Named after the ancient god Lugus, a symbol
        of protection and wisdom, the Centre embodies the principle of using
        knowledge and foresight to guard against potential dangers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, the Lugus Centre has grown from a small research group
        into an influential organization with a global reach. We have partnered
        with governments, academic institutions, and industry leaders to promote
        responsible AI development and to create frameworks for mitigating the
        risks associated with superintelligent AI.
      </p>

        At the Lugus Centre, we conduct cutting-edge research into the safety,
